# 20231001 Phones, Email, More Files, Google Drive and GitHub

We discussed how phones typically can handle email and SMS messages, but computers typically only handle email.  We talked more about how files are handled on GitHub and Google Drive as well as on the local computer.  As a young person, it's a good idea to only communicate with people you know already, and never give out any kind of personal information over the internet, by email, text or phone.  A lot of the discussions revolved around internet safety.
