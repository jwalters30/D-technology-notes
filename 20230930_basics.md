# 20230930 Computer Basics and Operating Systems 

On our first day of "technology education", we covered the basics of computers, operating systems, and a little bit of history of the 3 major PC operating system familes that are popular today (Windows, Mac and Linux).

## Computer Basics

All computers will do nothing without some kind of software that tells them what to do.  These instructions provided in the form of executable programs.  The programs that run the applications that people want to interact with are called operating systems.  There's a good Wikipedia article that can lead to a number of different topics at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer

## Operating System Basics

When discussing the basics of computer operating systems, going pretty far back to the DOS days is a fun trip down memory lane, and it introduces the concept of the command line and a single user operating system.  More information on that here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS 

DOS of course leads to Windows: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows

Unix was an operating system that really laid the foundations for all of the modern operating systems. RedHat has a bit of info at: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/unix-linux-history  Linux was started by Linus Torvalds while he was at university and has grown to one of the most popular operating systems in the world.  More information on Linux at: https://history-computer.com/the-complete-history-of-linux-everything-you-need-to-know/ and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-history/# 

The Mac operating system really developed the graphical user interface as we know it.  The Classic Mac Operating System really drove the ideas when every other computer didn't even have a mouse yet.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS  When the NeXT OS was developed by Steve Jobs it was the next foundation of the modern MacOS and is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS

## Applications

We covered the classic Windows games of Solitaire and Minesweeper. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/get-the-classic-free-solitaire-games-for-windows-92bf81e3-f34a-58b8-45b2-abe855aa64f2

We also talked a bit about files and folders under Windows.  There's some overview documents here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-and-open-file-explorer-ef370130-1cca-9dc5-e0df-2f7416fe1cb1 and here: https://www.teachucomp.com/how-to-cut-copy-and-paste-files-and-folders-in-windows-11-instructions/

## Adding Users and Connecting to WiFi

We can create local Windows accounts as described in https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-20de74e0-ac7f-3502-a866-32915af2a34d

We can create a local Linux user from the command line: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/create-a-user-account-on-ubuntu-linux/

It is common to make the same username in Windows and Linux so that the users can be shared between machines, even though they are really different users on each machine and in each OS.  Note that Linux users can't start with a capital letter.
